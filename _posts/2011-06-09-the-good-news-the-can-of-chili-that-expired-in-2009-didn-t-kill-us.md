#### Day 24: Sebree, KY to Cave in Rock, IL<br/>June 9, 2011

We got another early start today and rode about 20 miles to Clay, KY where we
stopped for second breakfast of eggs, "hash browns," and biscuits. It wasn't
very delicious and took a long time because they ran out of eggs. That will
probably be our last experiment with mid-day restaurant dining for a while.
The highlight of the day (and possibly Andrew's life) was definitely Hillside
Discount Groceries in Marion, KY. It is a roadside store run by the Amish that
sells damaged, past date, and overstocked packaged foods. It was amazing. We
bought Clif Bars for 20 cents each. Andrew ate a 10-inch diameter cinnamon roll
(freshly baked) for lunch. Shortly after the groceries, we reached and crossed
the Ohio River by ferry and arrived in Cave in Rock, IL. A new state! What's
that? You haven't heard of Cave in Rock? That's probably because it is the
armpit of Illinois (a local's statement, not ours, we just happen to agree).
There is actually some pirate history here but it was hard to get excited about
it due to the deafening roar of cicadas.  We camped in the state park. It was
horribly hot and the 13-year cicadas drove us crazy. We couldn't hear ourselves
think and they kept flying into us or crawling on us. Why did we camp here, you
ask? The motel was all booked for Hog Rock, a 15,000 person weekend-long
festival for Harley enthusiasts.

#### Day 25: Cave in Rock, IL to Tunnel Hill, IL<br/>June 10, 2011

We woke up disappointed we were still in Cave in Rock and escaped as soon as
possible. The morning was uneventful. We're not sure when the landscape changed
but suddenly there are pine trees all around as we rode through Shawnee
National Forest. We stopped for lunch in Eddyville after about 40 miles and
chatted with some Hog Rock people before pressing on.  For the evening, we
stayed in Tunnel Hill with another warmshowers couple. Ann and Al Stachowiak
signed up for warmshowers after Ann's brother used it on his bike trip. They
have over 60 acres of land and a log house they built themselves where we spent
the night. After sharing their yummy kabob dinner with them, we tagged along to
see their 6-year old granddaughter's softball game. Little League softball is
pretty hilarious. After the game we came home and chatted with Alan about
building the house, his property, his careers (Marine Corps, iron worker,
teacher) and his children.  For breakfast we had steel cut oats on the deck
with Alan, talked some more about his property and his house, and definitely
didn't turn down his offer for a ride into town when we saw the storm clouds
looming. Good thing, too. It POURED on the ride in to Carbondale. We're
spending Saturday in Carbondale taking care of some bicycle maintenance at one
of the three (!!!) bike shops in town and having a rest before hitting the
Ozarks.
