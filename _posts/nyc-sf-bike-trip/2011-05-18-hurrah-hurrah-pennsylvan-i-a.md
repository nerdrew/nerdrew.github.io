Not sure what all the hurrahs are for...it has rained on us pretty much the
whole time we've been here. Here's what we've been up to for the last 3 days.

#### Day 2: Raritan, NJ to Philadelphia, PA<br/>May 18, 2011

In a word: rain. Spitting rain through rolling hills and farmland. Stopped for
a short break in New Hope, PA which was cute. Pouring rain starting near
Warington and continuing most of the way to Conshohocken.  We got in early
enough to hang out with Ivy for a bit and admire her egg carton collection.
Mostly she watched us eat. Then our friends Nancy and Andrew took us to Ralph's
for dinner (classic family-run Italian) where they also watched us eat. Thanks
for a delicious meal guys!!  Things were slow this morning but picked by the
afternoon. We have some very tired legs and sore derri√®res.

* Starting point: Raritan, NJ
* Ending point: Philly, PA
* Slept: Ivy's house!
* Miles: 76.85
* Average speed: 10.5


#### Day 3: Philadelphia, PA to Denver, PA<br/>May 19, 2011

We had a lovely morning ride along the Schuylkill River trail from Philly all
the way to Valley Forge. It stopped raining long enough for a beautiful picnic
in VF, but not enough time for any revolutionary war reenactments. In the
afternoon we rode through nice scenic farm country with ultra green grass you
want to lay in unless it's pouring rain...followed by roller coaster hills,
forever.  We go to the Dutch Cousin campgrounds in Denver, PA (Lancaster
county) around 6:45, ate some canned food and passed out.

* Starting point: Philly, PA
* Ending point: Denver, PA
* Slept: campground / cabins
* Miles: 72.1
* Average speed: 9.5
* Notes: disgusting amount of peanut butter consumed.


#### Day 4: Denver, PA to Wrightsville, PA<br/>May 20, 2011

We were exhausted after yesterday so lazed around in the morning, mostly
complaining about our sore rear ends. We set off (in the rain) around 10am and
rode through more rolling hills and farm country that would probably be lovely
if not raining. We took a lunch break in Mannheim and also stocked up on food
for the next few meals.  We had off and on rain through Mt. Joy, Marietta, and
then pouring rain through Columbia and Wrightsville.  Around 4:30 in the
afternoon we arrived at the farm of Frank and Sally Harvey who allow
cross-country bicyclists to camp on their property for free! I'm writing this
from the attic of their barn!   I can't remember who gave us this advice but it
was really good: when it comes to biking in the rain, don't bother trying to
stay dry. Just focus on staying wet but warm. Our gear has been great for that.
Most notable: pearl Izumi leg warmers and our bright yellow (can't remember the
model) PI jackets that don't keep all the wet off but definitely protect
against the wind.

* Starting point: Denver, PA
* Ending point: Wrightsville, PA
* Slept: camped
* Miles: 45.25
* Average speed: 9.5
* Notes: Andrew's mind is addled...possibly gummed up from all the peanut butter?
