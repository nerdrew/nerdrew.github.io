#### Day 10: Rockfish Gap, VA to Natural Bridge, VA<br/>May 26, 2011

We got an early start today for a long, gradual climb through the Blue Ridge
Mountains. It wasn't nearly as steep as we expected and the views of the
mountains and valleys were phenomenal. At the , we dropped about 2000 feet in 3
miles, which was probably the most unpleasant part of the day. We felt like we
were getting carpal tunnel from braking so much and often felt like we couldn't
actually stop because it was so steep.  At the bottom, we had lunch at Gertie's
and "enjoyed" Gertie's confederate flags and soldier statue out front. From
Vesuvius to Lexington was a lovely, mostly downhill road along the river, which
was a much appreciated stretch for our legs. After stocking up at a grocery
store in Lexington we pressed on for another 10 miles to a campground near
Natural Bridge.  We also met a new companion today. A 20-year old's biking
companion was injured early in their ride so the non-injured one may be joining
us for a while. Hope he likes Hillary's rendition of John Denver's "Country
Roads."

* Starting point: Rockfish Gap, VA

#### Day 11: Natural Bridge, VA to Catawba, VA<br/>May 27, 2011

After some morning bike maintenance, we set off through Natural Bridge,
foregoing roadside attractions like Foamhenge, a replica of Stonehenge made of
giant foam pieces. We stopped for lunch in Daleville, ate some footlong
sandwiches, and tried to plan our afternoon. Today was one of those awkward
days when the distance between towns didn't really line up with how far we
wanted to go. Colin found a restaurant in Catawba that let's bikers camp on
it's lot so we headed for them.  On the way, it started POURING again, but much
warmer rain than what we had last week. In Catawba, we found a covered picnic
area in the park where we spread our stuff out to dry. Andrew asked at the
general store about places to camp and they offered the shed/room out back
which was delightfully dry.

* Starting point: Natural Bridge, VA
* Ending point: Catawba, VA
* Slept: "camped" in a room at the general store
* Miles: 54.04
* Average speed: 9.9
* Notes: rain, rain...
