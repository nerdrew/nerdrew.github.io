#### Day 22: near Hodgenville, KY to near Falls of Rough, KY<br/>June 7, 2011

Today was a hot one. We were all drenched in sweat before even leaving our
campsite this morning. Yuck. Very pretty, rural roads, lots of farms, and
flatter rolling hills. Unbeknownst to us (but knowst to others), there is a
sizable Mennonite population around here. It was nice to actually move faster
than another vehicle for once--those buggies have TWO horses and we still
passed them!  For lunch we picnicked outside a closed firehouse with a cyclist
couple from Florida we have seen a few times in past several days. The
afternoon was really hot...Drank a lot of water, sweat some more. Our legs are
feeling better--still tired, but not the weird soreness we had in the
mountains. Butts are about the same--there are good days and bad. In the
afternoon we also ran into 2 guys who are riding from Santa Cruz, CA. They were
complaining about the Ozarks but everything we've read says the Appalachians
are worse. We shall see.  We planned to camp at one of the many campsites in or
near the Rough River State Park but most of them were closed due to high water
levels. We'd heard through the cross-country-cyclist-rumor-mill that there was
an airstrip nearby...we found it easily and camped here for the night. The only
guidelines: camping on grass only. Guess we will have to save our dream of
camping on the tarmac for another day.

* Starting point: near Hodgenville, KY
* Ending point: near Falls of Rough, KY
* Slept: more like lay in our own sweat all night (camped)
* Miles: 57.2
* Average speed: 10.7
* Notes: hot


#### Day 23: near Falls of Rough, KY to Sebree, KY<br/>June 8, 2011

23 days in and Hillary finally prevailed on getting an early start. We left the
airstrip at 7am and had a nice, less sweaty morning. Another perk of getting up
early is that we saw tons of turtles sunning themselves rather than the usual
turtle roadkill. We stopped for second breakfast and water at around 9am--it
was nice to have 20+ miles behind us by then.  The rest of the day was really,
really hot. We had picnic lunch outside a convenience store and then sweat
through the afternoon. We pulled into Sebree a little after 4pm and found the
Baptist Church which runs a bike hostel in it's rec room downstairs. We were
REALLY happy to have clean showers and air conditioning.  Violet, the pastor's
wife invited us (5 cyclists in total) over for a huge dinner of salad, chicken,
rice, green beans, and PIE. After dinner we chatted with Violet and looked at
her cyclist guestbook and memorabilia (including an article about a guy who
rode his Penny Farthing across the country wearing a pith helmet and carrying a
riding crop to fend off dogs). The elderly neighbor had a thing for Hillary "I
bet you're real nice to travel with." Also, Violet's husband Bob went to
seminary in Mill Valley.

* Starting point: near Falls of Rough, KY
