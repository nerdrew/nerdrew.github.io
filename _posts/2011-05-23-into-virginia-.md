#### Day 7: Washington DC to Warrenton, VA<br/>May 23, 2011

In DC we went out to Ethiopian food for dinner with the logic that the
availability of ethnic food would quickly wane. It didn't rain! We sat outside!
After impressing the Pearls with our yogurt-eating abilities, we set off south.
Washington was so sad to see us go, the sent a motorcade to follow us out to
the Key Bridge. Leaving DC was really easy--the Custis Trail to the Washington
and Old Dominion Trail took us at least 15 miles on dedicated bike paths.
Things went downhill quickly with busy, 4-lane, divided roads. But, there were
often roadside paths or sidewalks. The scenery was pretty blah--sterile
suburbs, strip malls. The fact that stumbling upon a Costco at lunchtime was a
highlight pretty much sums up our day. Pizza!  After Manassas the roads were
much more empty and nice.Warrenton even had a bike path in to town. At this
point, we present our ode to railroad grade bike paths in haiku:  Railroad
grade bike paths Can't you go all the way West? Oh so flat and smooth  Today's
mileage wasn't too high and the hills weren't bad but we had our first actually
windy day--mostly in our face and side to side. Not looking forward to wind +
hills.

* Starting point: Washington, DC
* Ending point: Warrenton, VA
* Slept: motel
* Miles: 55.98
* Average speed: 9.9
* Notes: wind. Saw our second hawk holding a snake in its talons (large)


#### Day 8: Warrenton, VA to Charlottesville, VA<br/>May 24, 2011

Today ended up being longer than planned. First, because Google maps failed us
by sending us down a 4 lane divided highway and then left on a dirt road
through private property. Later, we were diverted by poor adherence to
directions because we were busy shaking our fists at Google.  We had our first
experience with dogs chasing us today. We had been advised that the best thing
to do is slow down and get off the bike on the opposite side. Totally
worked...dogs lost interest really fast.  Our knees are a bit sore. Legs are
tired but ok. Butt pain has plateaued, hopefully.  In Charlottesville we stayed
with an old friend of Hillary's. It was great to catch up, forage at Whole
Foods, and hang out with her cats and fish.

* Starting point: Warrenton, VA
* Ending point: Charlottesville, VA
* Slept: friend's house
* Miles: 75.13 Average speed: 9.7
* Notes: Andrew is really tired. Both of our knees were sore at the end of the day. Lots of turtle roadkill.
