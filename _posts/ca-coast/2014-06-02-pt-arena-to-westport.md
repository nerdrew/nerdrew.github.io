#### Day 3: Point Arena, CA to Wesport, CA<br>June 2, 2014

We had a breakfast feast in our room before heading out into the soggy
weather. The morning was a mix of soggy misty fog, high fog, and
constant rolling hills. The kind of hills that require the granny gear
and just kill your average speed. Eventually the fog lifted enough to
see the glorious ocean views from the Bluff (riding through Elk,
Albion). 

We stopped for lunch in Mendocino at Good Life cafe, where we had a
delicious veggie panini, split pea soup, lasagna, cookies, mmmmmm. From
Mendocino we got back on Highway 1 and discovered a HUGE shoulder all
the way to Fort Bragg -- busy road but nice riding. Fort Bragg was a bit
of a bust -- we picked up some so so supplies for dinner at the grocery
store full of alcoholics, and we ate some disappointing cookies. The
hippie grocery store appeared to sell bad smells only. And judgment. 

From Fort Bragg we rode on a coastal bike path, which offered a nice
break from the cars but terrible paving. The rest of the afternoon was
quite pleasant -- it was mostly sunny, we had rolling hills with a few
steeper climbs (on one we witnessed the filming of a car commercial). 

Westport is a tiny town -- we stayed at the one motel and we bought
sandwiches at the one store in town: they were much better than you
would have expected. We had a random dinner of sandwiches and weird
stuff we bought in Fort Bragg, then went to sleep early (no internet, no
decent movies).
