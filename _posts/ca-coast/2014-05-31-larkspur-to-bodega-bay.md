#### Day 1: Larkspur, CA to Bodega Bay, CA<br>May 31, 2014

We had a slow start on our first day: leaving Hammie in Mill Valley with
Gail and Steve, packing and repacking our bags, generally getting set
up. We left Larkspur at around 11am and rode out Sir Francis Drake out
through San Geronimo and Samuel P Taylor Park. It was a little sweaty on
the way up, but generally a delightful temperature. We stopped for lunch
at the Marshall Store where Andrew had tamales (on Tomales Bay, har har
har). 

The afternoon was chilly, with somewhat tiring rolling hills. We stopped
in Tomales where Andrew relived his childhood and we talked to some
Canadians who were doing the reverse of our route. The last 10 miles of
the day were hard, cold, and foggy. Bodega Bay looked pretty dismal when
we arrived, but a hot shower and mediocre burritos fixed us right up. We
fell asleep to a Steven Segal movie.
