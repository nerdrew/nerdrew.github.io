#### Day 7: Westport, CA to Mendocino, CA<br>June 6, 2014
We slept in a little because we had such a short day ahead of us, and
ate the rest of the granola before leaving. It was our misty-est morning
yet with water collecting on our glasses. We had a cold morning with
rolling hills all the way to Fort Bragg where we bought some crazy
socks, ate breakfast burritos, and saw 2 adorable blue tick hound
puppies. We considered bringing one home as a souvenir but decided
Hammie would revolt. 

We rode 10 more miles to Mendocino (again, on the really big smooth
shoulder) and ate lunch at Good Life Cafe again. In the afternoon we
showered, wandered around town, and spurned the request of the
“electronically sensitive” by taking pictures with our cell phones. We
had the nicest weather yet in the afternoon -- clear sunny views of the
ocean. Dinner was so-so pizza at Frankies. 

We were feeling pretty good after another short day -- something to keep
in mind if we do another long tour: breaks help!
