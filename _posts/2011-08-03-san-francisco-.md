#### Day 79: Napa, CA to San Francisco, CA<br/>August 3, 2011

After fueling on yogurt and cereal, we left Evan's house and rode to the
Vallejo ferry. Riding down 29 wasn't the best--there was a big shoulder but it
seems to be where Napa County stores its broken glass. But, we made it to
Vallejo pretty quickly and waited in the cold fog to depart.  It was the
perfect San Francisco day when we arrived--warm sun on the ferry building and a
great view of the bay. Hillary's mom and several of our friends came down to
welcome us and eat delicious Vietnamese food. A giant thank you to Krista, Sam,
Ian, Darin, Rachel, Zack, Brent, and Gail for coming out this afternoon!  After
much visiting and eating we rode the final 10 miles across the Golden Gate and
over to Hillary's parents' house. The bridge was a little bit of a disaster but
Gail met us in Sausalito and rode the last 5 miles with us and the fed us
freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. It feels great to be finished.
