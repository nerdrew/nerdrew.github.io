And it tastes like salad, asian food, It's-Its, and yogurt.

#### Day 77: Placerville, CA to Sacramento, CA<br/>August 1, 2011

Last night we had a surprise visit in Placerville from Erica on her way home
from Lake Tahoe. Hanging out with her at the taqueria was way better than going
back to our sketchy motel room. Today, we got up early and rode through
downtown Placerville (cute), down some winding roads to Folsom, where we got on
the American River trail which we took all the way to Sacramento.  Riding on a
bike path is great for the obvious no-car reason but also because all of the
old bikers want to talk to us. A couple of different old guys rode with us for
a bit, which made the time fly by. Also, the bike path is really, really nice.
We got to Erica's house at 11:30, showered, and got some sandwiches and salads
for lunch. Erica was an excellent host; not only did she tote us to various
delicious eateries, she also refrained from judging when we went to sleep at
9pm and she took us to Trader Joe's to get some of our favorite yogurt that we
haven't had since May 17.

#### Day 78: Sacramento, CA to Napa, CA<br/>August 2, 2011

We snuck out of Erica's house early and rode through Sacramento as the sun was
just hitting the Capitol. Next we rode through Davis and then along some
winding roads through various fruit crops. We saw tons of cyclists commuting to
work and others just out for a ride. It is funny to think back to when the only
other bicyclists we saw were on a tour like us. We stopped for a quick lunch in
Fairfield before making several failed attempts at cutting over to Napa (the
road we'd planned to take was WAY too busy to ride on).  Eventually, we
followed the biking map route most of the way to Vallejo and then cut through
American Canyon to Napa. Not terribly direct but it did take us past a gas
station selling It's-Its (a San Francisco ice cream treat, for the uninformed).
Now it even tastes like home! We arrived at Evan's house at around 5 when we
promptly ate about a pound of blueberries and took showers. Evan cooked us an
amazing feast for dinner. There were these weird colorful things in the
food...I think he said they are called "vegetables."

Photos: We are total failures and didn't take a single photo of the scenery (it was so familiar it didn't seem necessary). So instead, here is some photographic evidence of our culinary return to the Bay.
