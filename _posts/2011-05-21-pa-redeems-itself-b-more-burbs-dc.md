#### Day 5: Wrightsville, PA to Owings Mills, MD<br/>May 21, 2011

Pennsylvania redeemed itself a little today. After a great night's sleep in the
Harvey barn we packed up, stopped by the Harvey house for a quick goodbye and
rolled off for our first RAIN FREE day. We had gentle rolling hills through
beautiful farm country, roadside stands of Mennonites selling baked goods, and
no rain!  Today we felt a lot better too. Tired muscles but the good,
exercise-induced feeling of tired, rather than the I'm-broken-in-10-places kind
of sore. Maybe it was the shorter day yesterday. Maybe it was the dry skies.
Maybe it was the milkshake and chocolate raisins at lunch in Jarettsville.
Either way, things were much better today. We also arrived at our destination
in a relatively lucid state. We spent the night with Harry, our friend's
brother, who fed us a giant feast for dinner. Thanks for the hospitality,
Harry! And a big thanks to Krista, our official Googler!  Starting point:

* Wrightsville, PA
* Ending point: Owings Mills, MD
* Slept: friends house
* Miles: 75.38
* Average speed: 10.2
* Notes: Andrew ate an entire pig's worth of ribs


#### Day 6: Owings Mills, MD to Washington, DC<br/>May 22, 2011

We got an early start and rode through more Baltimore suburbs which were
surprisingly wooded and green. The hills were gentler than yesterday and
flattened out as we got closer to DC. We had a tasty picnic lunch in Rock Creek
Park (photo below is mostly to demonstrate that we do, in fact, change our
clothes). We rode the Rock Creek Trail most of the way in and a kindly biker
Ray led us in for the last bit to get to Logan Circle.  We stopped by a bike
shop to clean our chains, which were super dirty from 4 days of rain. It's kind
of fun going into a bike shop with our loaded up bikes--everyone wanted to know
about our trip and they even threw in some free chain oil. Tonight we are
staying with David and Joanna, who kindly offered to host us again despite
arriving empty-handed (yogurt containers are a bit bulky for panniers).

* Starting point: Owings Mills, MD
* Ending point: Washington, DC
