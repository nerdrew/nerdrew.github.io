On Saturday morning we peeled ourselves out of bed to go to St. John the Divine
(conveniently located at the end of our block) for the 13th annual Blessing of
the Bikes. A couple hundred people showed up for Reverend Tom's sermonette on
the goodness of bicycling. Highlights included having holy water flung on our
bikes and a sea of bike bells rather than "amens."
