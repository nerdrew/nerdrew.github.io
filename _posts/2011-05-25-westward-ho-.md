#### Day 9: Charlottesville, VA to Rockfish Gap, VA<br/>May 25, 2011

We hung a right at Charlottesville and started heading westward...  Today was a
quasi-break day. We kept the mileage and speed down in an effort to make some
progress but generally rest our legs and knees. From Charlottesville things
quickly became pretty rural, with beautiful (though daunting) views of the Blue
Ridge Mountains in the distance. We took a mid-morning break at Wyant's General
Store in White Hall to refill on water, eat a grease-bomb grilled cheese
sandwich (guess who) and sign the proprietor's bike guest book. It is COUNTRY
out here. Another exciting development was the presence of Transamerica bike
ride road signs all over the place, which made navigating a lot easier.  We had
a late lunch in Afton where we went on a fruitless search for the infamous
cookie lady who feeds/hosts bicyclists. She wasn't home but fortunately, we had
our own cookies (thank goodness!). We rode up to the Blue Ridge Parkway and
decided to stop for the night in a really creepy motel. We spent the afternoon
catching up on emails, resting our legs, and....dum, dum, dum (suspense)...
eating! Oh, and also enjoying an amazing view of the valley below.

* Starting point: Charlottesville, VA

* Notes: slow and short on purpose, to preserve our knees and legs
