#### Day 14: Troutdale, VA to near Rosedale, VA<br/>May 30, 2011

Leaving Troutdale we continued our climb for a few miles and then had a
wonderful, breezy, 15-mile descent into Damascus. In Damascus we had
second-breakfast, Andrew visited a bike shop to diagnose his bottom bracket
clicking (grit), and Hillary drank about a gallon of water. Food options are
getting grim. See photos.  From there we rode another 15 or so miles, ate some
more, and then started a brutal, steep, climb up from Hayter's Gap. (1500 foot
climb over 3-4 miles) Did we mention that it is really hot in Virginia? We had
another quick descent and then stopped for the night outside of Rosedale at the
Elk Garden United Methodist Church. The grounds have a covered picnic area, a
full kitchen with a bunch of canned goods, and a hose out back (it seemed a
little weird getting naked in a church backyard but the hose shower was quite
refreshing after a long day).
