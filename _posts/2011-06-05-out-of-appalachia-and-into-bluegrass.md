#### Day 20: Berea, KY to Mackville, KY<br/>June 5, 2011

After another delightful night's sleep in a real bed we said goodbye to Berea
and continued West. The route today was a cyclist's paradise with gentle
rolling hills throughout the day. In addition to the smoother terrain, we
appreciated the transition out of coal country and back into farm land.  Not
much of note happened today other than a brief interaction with a nice, older
gentleman (with an Obama bumper sticker on his car) who was immensely amused
that we'd travelled all the way from New York. New York City?!? (think of the
old Pace Picante commercials.)  There was a dearth of accommodations in the
area but we had a very successful first use of warmshowers.org (a website that
lists households across the world that are willing to host cyclists--some
provide a backyard for camping, others, full accommodations). We stayed at the
home of Keith and Alicia Katterheinrich who have been hosting cyclists for the
past 5 years. After a nice shower, some laundry, and a delicious meal we
settled in to the living room to hang out with Alicia and her kids Joel and
Benjamin. Another incredibly generous and hospitable family! Andrew also
test-rode their Co-Motion tandem bike and is now obsessed.

* Starting point: Berea, KY
* Ending point: Mackville, KY
* Slept: the Katterheinrich home
* Miles: 64.1
* Average speed: 10.0
* Notes: Nice, easy day after the Appalachians


#### Day 21: Mackville, KY to near Hodgenville, KY<br/>June 6, 2011

In the morning, we had a big breakfast of eggs, sausage, biscuits, and oatmeal.
Keith helped Andrew with some bike maintenance (cleaned the bottom bracket)
while Hillary and Collin got an early start.  More of the same, farm-y
landscape with more horses today. Some nasty dogs chased us but didn't attack.
Another thing of note: we had an usually number of people yelling at us from
cars--some nice "don't get too hot, drink some water!"and some not-so-nice
"hooooooonnnnnnnnkkkkkk, hoooooonnnnnnkkkk." Not sure what to make of
this...maybe people in this part of Kentucky like to express themselves while
driving?  Despite assurances from 2 places that rooms would be available, there
were no vacancies when we reached our destination ("destination" = near
Hodgenville and the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln). But, the nice man at the
Nancy Lincoln log cabins said we could camp there and use the showers, so it
worked out pretty well.

* Starting point: Mackville, KY
* Ending point: near Hodgenville, KY
* Slept: camped
* Miles: 72.66
* Average speed: 10.5
* Notes: Even the rolling hills are getting a little old...
