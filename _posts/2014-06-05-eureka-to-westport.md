#### Day 6: Eureka, CA to Westport, CA<br>June 5, 2014
We’ve had good ideas, but our greatest idea was to skip riding on 101 on
the way back south. So, after yogurt and granola in our motel room, we
caught the local bus back to Garberville. My my my. The bus was filled
with: at least one guy on his way home from jail, several completely
strung out people, and so many smells. 

We got off the bus in Garberville, ate some bagels, and overheard these
inspiring words: “Since I quit my job and moved up here my work ethic
has been through the roof. The other day, I wanted to do a one-armed
push up and I just tried it. I didn’t actually do one, but I tried, man. 

From Garberville we hitchhiked to Leggett (weirdly got a ride from
someone who knows someone we know), and started riding again on 1. We
had 4-5 miles of sweaty climbing then some glorious long descents. Some
kindly motorcyclists clocked our speed on the hill (38 mph), and we got
unfortunately chilly on the second descent. A bizarre convoy of 6
Porsche Cayennes passed us and Andrew had the epiphany that “California
is so pretty, the roadside trash is redwood bark). 

Back in Westport we got sandwiches and rented the Brother’s Grimm. We
felt pretty great after such a short day.
