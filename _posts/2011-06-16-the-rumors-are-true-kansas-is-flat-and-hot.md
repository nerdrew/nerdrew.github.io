#### Day 31: Summersville, MO to Hartville, MO<br/>June 16, 2011

We got an early start and had a nice, cool morning of rolling hills and a quick
shower of wood chips from a passing truck. The Ozarks are flattening
out...we're kind of riding along a flat top of plains atop the Ozarks. People
have been very eager to talk to us, especially about the Ozark "mountains." We
haven't had the heart to tell them that they just aren't that tall.  We saw a
lot of roadkill armadillos. We camped for the night on the courthouse lawn in
Hartville. Unfortunately, we couldn't find showers so we took birdbaths in the
sheriff's bathroom. There are lots of fireflies.  It was a good day, but
nothing of note really happened.

* Ending point: Hartville, MO
* Slept: camped on the courthouse lawn
* Miles: 65
* Average speed: 10.6


#### Day 32: Hartville, MO to Ash Grove, MO<br/>June 17, 2011

After camping out at the courthouse and overhearing some amazing would-be "bro"
brawls in the middle of the night, we got up early and hit the road before 7am.
The morning was uneventful and mostly downhill-we put in 47 miles before
stopping for a picnic lunch under a town pavilion.  The afternoon was hot and
slow, with a series of sneaky short hills. It felt like the Ozarks overheard us
saying they aren't real mountains and threw in some nasty foothills for good
measure. Nevertheless, we rolled in to town by 3:30 to discover an awesome town
park to camp in. It had showers and a swimming pool with free swimming for
cyclists. And also, a town full of the friendliest people. A friend of ours
gave us advice before we left that we should meet as many midwesterners as
possible because "they are the nicest." She's right. They are the nicest!  We
decided to treat ourselves to an air-conditioned dinner and went to Mama Loca's
for Mexican food. It was no Mission burrito, but it hit the spot. The location
was a former catfish house and the proprietors kept the giant woodcarving of a
bear holding a fish and put a colorful poncho on it. We got dessert at the
bakery across the street where they also gave us some free peaches. We camped
in the park with 2 other sets of cyclists--Ned and Kristin who we see a lot of
and the "Bash Bros," 2 brothers from Florida whose last name is not Bash but
are brothers. The lawn was cushy but it was really hot for sleeping outside.

#### Day 33: Ash Grove, MO to Pittsburg, KS<br/>June 18, 2011

We got another early start and had a pleasant morning of some small hills and
reasonable temperatures. We stopped for water and a snack in Golden City and
learned that in the future, Hillary should ignore her craving for fake Fig
Newtons. They just aren't very good.  Immediately after Golden City, MO we had
a premonition of what is to come. Usually our maps have us make turns at least
every 5 miles or so. This afternoon: 33 with no turns (literally, a straight
line). Wheee. We did stop and talk for a bit with a nice guy named Joel about
the house he is building with his family, growing up in the area, and local
farming (wheat--we tried some freshly picked, corn, soybeans). He also gave us
some deliciously cold water.  Shortly afterward we crossed into Kansas. Yay!
Our ninth state! We stopped for the night in Pittsburg, a town of ~20,000 and
home of Pitt State. In other news, we blew it. Big Brutus, the world's second
largest electric mining shovel is 22 miles south of here. Unfortunately, we are
headed in the opposite direction and can't muster the energy to backtrack.
After showering, eating at another Mexican restaurant, and picking up some
fresh fruit, we did some pirate laundry at a nearby Holiday Inn before heading
back to our own, laundry-less motel. As we walked back, we watched the
lightning bolts of an approaching storm and then watched unbelievably bright
lightning from the comfort of our air-conditioned room.

* Average speed: 11.5


#### Day 34: Rest day in Pittsburg, KS<br/>June 19, 2011

We decided to give our legs (let's be honest, mostly our butts) a rest in a
comfortable town so we slept in this morning, enjoyed the motel breakfast
buffet, and did some errands.  At around noon we attempted to walk to the city
water park. Hillary quickly concluded that 94 degrees was way too hot for
voluntarily being outside on an alleged rest day and fled for the hotel to
shower and hibernate in the air conditioning for most of the afternoon. Andrew
and Collin made the prudent decision to ride their bikes to the water park,
though Andrew made the rather imprudent decision of bringing only a Speedo on
this trip. Despite his best efforts, Andrew did not attract the attention of
the authorities and after the pool, we all feasted on Chinese food at Yummy
Buffet. It was pretty yummy and the cashier really liked Andrew's t-shirt of a
blob monster eating the US Capitol.
