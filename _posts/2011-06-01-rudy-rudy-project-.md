No, we aren't watching vintage sports movies...  Our arrival in Berea marked
another exciting event: our mail pickup of exciting new gear from Rudy Project.
We are lucky enough to have a connection at Rudy who hooked us up with new
sunglasses, hats, and a helmet for Hillary. We haven't road tested any of the
gear yet but we're pretty excited about it. Thanks Wagners!!

Side note: delirium made applying the helmet pads harder than splitting the atom...I think
we got it right.
