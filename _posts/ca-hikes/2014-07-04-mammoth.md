#### Mammoth Mountain<br/>July 4, 2014

We went to Mammoth for a long weekend in July 2014. 

On the first day we went for a hike from the Mosquito Flat trailhead to Little
Lakes Valley. We passed about 9 lakes: Mack, Marsh, Heart, Box, Chickenfoot,
Gem, Upper Morgan, Lower Morgan. Not sure about the mileage but guessing ~8
miles.

On the second day we hiked to Ediza Lake and Iceberg Lake. We took the free
shuttle in Mammoth to the trailhead and then hiked ~13-14 miles out and back.
